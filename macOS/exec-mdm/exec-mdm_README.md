# exec-mdm

**`exec-mdm`** is a command-line tool for managing and executing scripts on devices using the [SimpleMDM API](https://simplemdm.com). It simplifies the process of searching for devices, selecting scripts, and running them across multiple devices efficiently.

## Features

- **Interactive Script Picker:** Browse available scripts using an intuitive arrow-key interface and select the desired one.
- **Device Lookup:** Search for devices by name and collect their IDs for batch operations.
- **Script Execution:** Execute scripts on multiple devices with a single command.
- **Pagination Support:** Handles large lists of scripts by automatically fetching all available entries from the API.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Python libraries:
  - `requests`
  - `inquirer`

   Device ID for 'macmini-r8-100': 477936
   Enter the device name to look up (or type 'done' to finish): done
